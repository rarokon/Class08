            <h2>School Homework Lists</h2>
            <article>               
               <p> When you're given homework where you have to memorize some type of list, this tool can be the perfect study aid. For example, if part of your science class requires you to memorize the periodic table, you can import the chemical element list. You can then use the list randomizer to study the symbol and the atomic number of each random one displayed. You can use this list generator for any list you need to study at school.</p>

                <h3>Foreign Language Vocabulary</h3>
                <p> If you're studying a foreign language, this tool can be an excellent resource. One issue with random foreign language word generators is that the words may not be for the exact level you're at. This isn't a problem with the list generator. Input your current vocabulary lists, click the random generate button and the list randomizer will ensure you have a simple way to study for your next test. </p>

            <h2>To-Do Lists</h2>
            <p>We all have to-do lists and the items on the lists are usually there because you have procrastinated due to not wanting to do them. You stare at the list not being able to decide which one to do out of all the ones that need to be done. One way to jumpstart checking off the items on your to-do list is to have the list randomizer randomly choose the next one you need to complete. </p>
